## Objective

The objective of this task was to use free tools to identify common vulnerabilities on a personal computer.

## Tools Used

Nessus Essentials: A free vulnerability scanner used to perform the scan.

## Scan Target

The scan target was the local machine, identified by the IP address `192.168.240.141`.

## Steps Performed

1.  Installation: Nessus Essentials was installed on the local machine.
2.  Scan Setup: A new scan was configured in Nessus Essentials, targeting the local machine's IP address (`192.168.240.141`). The scan type was "Host Discovery".
3.  Scan Execution: The scan named "Prasad.Demo" was initiated and completed.
4.  Report Review: The generated report was reviewed for identified vulnerabilities and their severity levels.

## Scan Results Summary
The scan was conducted on **June 26, 2025, at 1:39 PM IST**.
Host Scanned: `192.168.240.141`.
Total Vulnerabilities: 2.
Vulnerabilities by Severity:
    Critical: 0 
    High: 0 
    Medium: 0 
    Low: 0 
    Info: 2 
 
 "INFO" level findings typically don't require "fixes" in the traditional sense, as they are informational and not security risks. However, if higher severity vulnerabilities were found, researching their fixes would be crucial.
## Document Critical Vulnerabilities
Since I have only found "INFO" level vulnerabilities, there aren't "critical vulnerabilities" to document in detail.
